# taps
Taps is a text adventure parser written in Python 3.

By defining the way in which Taps interacts with an adventure game or other text-input driven software, Taps _should_ be loosely coupled enough to work with more than one game.

Taps will:
* be written in pure Python 3
* allow for customization of known words
* able to work with a variety of text adventure or text-input driven software
